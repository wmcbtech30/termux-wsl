# Termux packaged in WSL environment
PoC Termux environment ported into Microsoft's [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL)

# Building
The termux environment was reused from [Termux's docker image](https://github.com/termux/termux-docker)

Procedure was done as follows:
* Pulls the docker image from docker hub (x86_64 by default)
* Inspects the image and create a new container for exporting
* Initializes `wsl.conf`, `passwd` database for proper operation
* Export the container it via `docker export`
* `gzip`s the tarfile generated by docker

You can run the `build.ps1` script to build a rootfs optimized for WSL

# Running
You can import the image from self-generated one or from releases page. download the rootfs and import it with command:
```
wsl.exe --import termux-wsl.tar.gz
```

It will generate static DNS and logs you in to Termux

# Problems
I didn't catch any problems yet. so far but usual problems for running this image are missing Android runtime features like OpenSLES. however Termux continues to work without it

apart from this, you cannot use ARM images. and I don't support it (I don't have a Windows ARM device yet for testing)
